# Tableau-Visualizations-for-UFO-Sightings
This repository contains screenshots of various Tableau dashboards created with UFO Sightings data. If you would like to see how this data was gathered, please direct yourself to my SQL Exploration project repository.

The USTableauDashboard screenshots and video showcase a highly interactive tableau dashboard involving state-to-county change of tables by selection of a map. The three screenshots show the beginning dashboard (1) and what happens when you click on a state (2 & 3). The video shows the interactions in real time.

Make sure to switch all dashboards to desktop view and full screen them if the organzation ofthe tables is disorderly!
