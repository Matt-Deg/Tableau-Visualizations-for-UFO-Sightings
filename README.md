# Tableau-Visualizations-for-UFO-Sightings
This repository contains screenshots of various Tableau dashboards created with UFO Sightings data. If you would like to see how this data was gathered, please direct yourself to my SQL Exploration project repository.

Make sure to switch all dashboards to desktop view and full screen them if the organzation ofthe tables is disorderly!
